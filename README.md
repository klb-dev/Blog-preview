# Frontend Mentor - Blog preview card

## Process

- I used vanilla HTML and CSS (no frameworks)
  - Development environment is Visual Studio Code
  - Figma to get the dimension and basic look. There are some discrepancies with font size so I chose what felt natural.
  - Flexbox
  - Mobile first

## Learning
  - DRY code - applying the major code in the body (font, size, color) so I didn't have to continually write the same lines.
  - Even with figma design as a developer I need to be able to access if all is accurate. There are some discrepancies for the font size between mobile and desktop. When using figma it would tell me one size but the style sheet has a different one. Being aware of this difference makes a better developer.

## Continued Development

- Continue doing Frontend Mentor projects to get better at my skills.
- Code daily for at least an hour.

## Resources
